-------------------------------------------

## General Info 

- Tutor: Dave Bracken :scientist:
- Classes: Wednesday's 13:00 - 15:00, X305 & Friday's 13:00 - 15:00, X305 :school:
- Lanuage: Python :snake:

## Course Outline

To introduce students to the development of software.
- Apply fundamental programming techniques.
- Demonstrate ability to create programs from specifications and designs.
- Apply knowledge of standards and tools to build, test and document applications.

## This Repo Contains

### Labs
- The `Labs` directory contains `Lab-X-X-X` (Structure is Lab-[Week Number]-[Topic Number]-[Activity Number])
- Each `Labs` file is the same as the folder name with the question number appended, e.g. `Lab-X-X-X-Q1.py`
- At the beginning of each file Labs are required to contain the following text. (Required!)

```Python
# Lab X-X-X Question 1
# Full Name
# myemail@arastudent.ac.nz
```

### Class notes
- The `Notes` directory contains the class notes taken during lessons.
- Within the directory is each file named after each class
- Naming structure is `wkX-LX.py` (Structure is wk[Week Number]-L[Lesson Number].py)
- To keep things simple the start of every notes file is mostly the same as `Labs`.

```Python
# Week X Lesson X
# Intro to Programming
# [THIS LESSONS TOPIC]
```

### JavaScript Versions

This is an extra thing I elected to do to make sure my JavaScript skills are sharp.
- Each file is named after the Python file that it is replicating e.g `Lab-X-X-X-Q1.js`
- The JavaScript file doesn't replicate the beginning text as seen in the `.py` file it is replicating, just a basic rundown of what the program attempts to achieve.
