# Psuedocode
# Psuedocode is a way of writing code without using the syntax of a programming language to describe the logic of a program.
# Examples of psuedocode can be found in wk3.L1.md

# Contitional statements
# Example

first_number = 1
second_number = 2

if first_number > second_number:
    print('The first number is greater than the second number.')

# Returns nothing because the first number is not greater than the second number.

# Example 2

another_first_number = 3
another_second_number = 2

if another_first_number > another_second_number:
    print('The first number is greater than the second number.')

# Returns 'The first number is greater than the second number.' because the first number is greater than the second number.
